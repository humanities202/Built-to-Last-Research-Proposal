    <p>Historically, men and women have been in pursuit of healthier living standards that typically lead to the utilization of fitness outlets
      revolving around the gym, training programs, and dietary approaches in support of a health and exercise. Spread among four traditional types of
      exercise: aerobic, strength, flexibility, and balance. The purpose of this ethnographic approach is to test whether there are implications of 
      adverse health benefits among men and women who compete at a national/professional bodybuilding level. To better understand the nature of the 
      sport and the impacts of stage competition amongst competitors who are subject to extreme criticism, expectation, and mirror culture.</p>
